% In the Participation Agreement, 
% Amazon claims to have the right to "initiate a credit to Seller's Account 
% on a rolling 14-day cycle.".
% However, Amazon then claims the right to an additional five business days 
% for the funds to actually be credited to the seller's account. 
% Even taking into account this liberally and unilaterally extended 
% period for payment, Amazon routinely fails to credit sellersâ€™ accounts timely.
